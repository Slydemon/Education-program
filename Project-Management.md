# Project Management
Project management in the most essential step that you can learn as a developer. The difference between a developer that knows project management and one that does not, is that people generally don't want to work with the latter.

Project management in development is maybe the most underrated aspect of programming. 
Project management is sometimes also referred to as " Documenting ".

A good thing to keep in mind as a programmer is: 
'Document your code like the one that will be viewing it is a psychopath with an attitude problem, who has your adress.'
